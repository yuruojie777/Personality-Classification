      "Actually from these results it looks like you are triplewithdrawn 5w4 9w8 4w5  It would appear that you just happen to have strong 2 6 and 7 traitsIts odd that you are associating the whole

My mom Go do insert known todo task here Me I know My mom Well if you know then why do not you go do it  yeah I am not oneIm gonna guess the EJ types are most likely to groupthink but I am not entirely sure  Thoughts  Also which types are least likely to groupthinkVery true  My guess is that 9s are the most idealized type thanks to our high levels of neutrality and inner tranquility but from the perspective of a 9 it is not worth it to idealize any type I hardly ever wear hats if at all  Nice new avatar BTW dealwithitThe ENTJ I am currently living with apparently has used his Se via cooking amid other things I am not 100 sure of  Hes quite nice with Se compared to TeNi alone  Sometimes I kinda wonder howYou have been criticized of having less thanks than posts guiltyA Type 9 looks at the poll  Were so popular proud  Goes and votes for 9  EDIT and 9th vote  What a number crazyIt seems both of the ISPs seem to hold out relationships and get married longer than the ESPs  Also some stats from Personality Page  Highest Percentage Married   From highest toLooks back at thread  Riiiiiiiiiight so why did I create this thread dry  maybe too much like comparing an ISTP to an INTPMaybe an INTP in a TiSi loop  I tend to be nitpicky about my environment as well due to my high SiSo am I and although my 5w6 is close I am a 9w1 I have absolutely no 8 anywhere in my Enneagram type at allNot to mention it feels somewhat disturbing and unreal to do it all the timePSTypes Enneagram Test Results  The Distribution of Your Scores    Type One  15  Type TwoIm probably the one all the way to the right   Am I now weird for looking well crazyMaybe because Enneagram is not as official and popular as MBTI and so it is hard to find broad realworld statsTP and FP are not necessarily associated with a Pe function  Theyre associated with domaux Ti and Fi respectively  Anyway you could divide up the 16 types in a number of ways of four EJ EPNot an SJ but my mom who is an SJ her parents are most likely ESFJ and ISTPWhy  The discussions fine  nothings heated up in hereI used to wear a watch when I was younger but watches tend to irritate my wrist so I stopped  Besides there are other ways for me to tell time when it is necessary  Also beware under1 Words of Affirmation  Meh  2 Gifts  Giving them yep  Receiving them is another story  3 Acts of Service1 Not entirely sure  Theyre mostly about places than anything else  Seldom if at all are there people in my dreams 2 Often like most other things I remember a dream quite vividly but theTheyll probably get along quite well  This is probably true for any XwY with a YwX  BTW if you were wondering the little w between the numbers stands for wing not with it can be unclearIve wondered how common each of the 9 fundamental Enneagram types are  Does anyone know or have a linkFrom typelogiccom  Intuition is tertiaryas the ESFJ matures and as situations arise which call for suspension of criticism Ne is allowed to play  Under the leadership of the Fe functionFrom typelogiccom  As the ESTJ matures and as situations arise which call for suspension of criticism Extraverted iNtuition is allowed to play  Under the leadership of the Te functionAgain sorry if I am harsh  Try not to take everything here personally  If you look inside the parentheses there is my alternate possibility Im not inconsiderate  It turns out I was justI tend to apologize like that too very reasoned out  Maybe it is a TF thingThis obligation of SJs not just ESTJs amid others is what drives me up a wall sometimes  My ESFJ mother has this tendency to do this to me although not to the degree you are encountering  I find this interesting  I never would have guessed that an ESTJ would tell a white lie this in part due to my stereotypical views of ESTJs  As a thinking type I might get thrown off by this andNot to be harsh but speaking of lies you could be lying about your strong STJ  It looks like you are just strong J either that or I could be misreading the scale  So another question whatHeres a third ISTP to add to that  I will say though that because of my autism I have an unusually strong Si  It could happen to an ISFP and the result could be an autistic ISFP with ISFJHere I replied to your thread happy crazy  Anyway I once read that IFPs such as you do not seem to have much patience with types whose preferences are strongly T or J let alone TJMostly Se and Ni  I rule with Ti so I do not need work there  Te and Fi are doing OK and they will develop better in my later life  Ne I just suck at and Fe I am not too good with either  BothP S  Why do you terms and conditions have to be so long  Do you have any idea how discouraging and redundant that is  Ever heard of plain English and not legaleseI need to get out more recurringthoughtofmineSounds like you need to relax  It also sounds like you need to forgive your INTPs detached perceiving nature  Maybe he got quickly boredThanks to everyone here who shared their twosided Se understanding  I remember my high school ENFJ teacher taking us outside during homeroom  Se relief proudFirst impression ESTJ maybe with a strong Se  Certainly underdeveloped in terms of cognitive functions such as Ne and FiIt looks like you have just won out the rest of us either that or you were not being true to yourselfISTJ Cup of coffee ESTJ Judges mallet for lack of a proper name if there is one ISTP Someone fixing up their cool vehicle be it a car motorcycle bicycle or otherwise ISFP An artistThe question is will it be because we humans could control ourselves or because mother nature forced usI would guess this is an Si thing    Given my strong Si I have become like this as well  However being an SP I do not need routine just need to know how it worksI find it fascinating that some ISFJs have higher Te than Ti  It had me wondering if most other SJs have higher Te and Fe than their Ti and Fi  When my ESFJ mother tested out she had higher TeHow nostalgic are you  It would appear that Si nostalgia is fairly strong among you ESFJs being SiauxI wondered where this thread went  has a thought of music and therefore cannot be describedFrom an ISTP with aux Se this is an insightful thread  I have sometimes wondered if ENFJs or ENxJs for that matter experience Se in a hereandnow manner like SPs doI can imagine like any identity relationship that it will be a nice one but eventually will get boring  I sometimes wonder what an ISFPISTP relationship would look likeLets see  Playing games especially ones that integrate the Ti element which few adventurous games seem to do skiing biking hiking climbing procrastinating here not uncommon among us\n",

to help discover1 Log in after a week or so of not being on here 2 Look at INFJ forum sees that all the new threads are already ones that I have seen and discussed in the past 3 Check the new posts in case II hope everyone realizes the difference between a nice guy and a well nice guywwwyoutubecomwatchvDOX9l4Ys7NYI would retire my account since I do not ever come on here anymore and I do not really care about MBTI anymore but why put an unnecessary restriction on myselfIm not a virgin In some ways I still wish I wasI lost my virginity to someone who I was not in love with The girl I am with right now is and if it were not for that one girl I would be too andIm 21 I am young amiriteHaving the feeling of being alone  Being able to tell a lot about a person just by their energy Its almost like I have known them for years And then if they find this out it freaks them out think it might be more of a biological thing and how you were raised more than how it is based on your type but I can see how type could play a part  As for meyeah I am nowhere near anI suppose I still am but I have lowered my standards so much to where I date people I do not even like probably just to not feel alone I am a little disgusted with myself at the moment know what you mean I have had this same problem for the longest time and I too can seem to spark relationships better over text Weird But anyways I have just forced myself to be a little moreI can imagine most INFJs can relate to this    trust test results That being said I could very well be an INFJ type 3My views have always been that I will never have sex with someone that I know is just gonna lead to sex and that is it Up to this point I have followed through to that because I cannot imagine givingFor me like most of you it comes out very early on but I try to control my tongue for as long as I can so I hardly ever say it at all at least intentionally At the beginning I think it is lessRight now I am debating whether I am an ENTP or INFJ  Sounds very strange but both of them fit meWho does not get a little genocidal every now and thenWalter may actually be an INFJ not an INTJ The reason I say this is that it is VERY clear to me that Gus is an INTJ but there seems to be some variance between them I will be able to explain moreBout damn timeIm a dude so it is kind of embarrassing that I like this show but it is not too bad The only two I know are Lorelai and Rory and they are ESFP and INFJISFJ respectively   would say you are an ESFP or ENFP probably leaning stronger with ESFP over ENFP  Youre not introverted At allAre you seriously basing your dating life based on some Personality Theory that may or may not be bullshitI seriously hope this is a joke thread Its getting that bad that I cannot tell if someone is trolling or just flat out fucking stupid  As for who is going to winunless Romeny wins theCongratulationsI never made one in the first place sohey  I am not sure why I am even making this as I am probably just gonna retire this account soon anyway but ya know just thought I would make oneYoure typism  Honestly I do not really have a specific type that annoys me Stupid annoys me not type  That being said for the love of FSM and all that is holy I am NEVER EVER EVER this is not the first time you have posted something like this in the two years I have been here it is in all likelihood depression dude I had the same symptoms for oh 7 years or so and when IIm my own partnerEDIT I guess that is what I get for not reading the whole postCan I come tuck you inYoure probably a 3 then  I am a type three myself and I fall into the more reserved category with most people I would still consider myself extroverted but people who talk nonstop actually get common I am a 3 but a 3w4 not a 3w2Not at all ENTP I would say ISTP or ESTP if that does not work the words right out of my mouthJust so everyones clear getting a percentage on a MBTI does not mean you are 75 introvert It means you can be pretty confident you are an introvert  Back on topic I am pretty much certain thatYeah same thing happened to me Fuckers  Dear stupid peoplejust because I do not show it does not mean I am not judging you At least you keep me entertained  Excuse my misogyny but fuckTell me about it But ironically I am dating a girl from California who moved over here a while ago and I met her through Ok Cupid Didnt actually expect that thing to produce results but it hasId say Obama is most definitely an ENFJ Speaking to common values but sticking to his own internal vision etc  Sarah PalinESFJ  Ronald ReaganHard to tell Probably ESTP in my opnion \n",

is building an amazing foundation We love to express our feelings for each other through poetry my preference through drawings  art his preference WeHey INFPs  barely post anymore I just wanted to share that I met my INFP boyfriend on Feb 4th of this year We met through a dating app We have never been more in love  we have both described ourIts been six dates and I found myself an INFP he took the test  and yes he is an INFP The connection is just so amazing and intense right now it even scares me  He told me he has neverI am curious what you would like Yeah we ENFJs are unique Wonder if this has to do with enneagramlove stylesI do not have a ton of info as I have not met this guy in person  only chatted with him yesterday for the first time online Heres what I do know  according to his profile he is looking forHere are some signs  they tend to talk faster  they will have a tougher time filling in gaps in the conversation sometimes they will not initiate the interaction get a bit more shy or wait tillDislike my INFP bestfriends sister We only just met this month I do not know I felt strangely upset about why I do not like her sister and guilty The girl is so selfabsorbed  does things thatYeah I hear you there You just never know that you will fall in love with someone It does come out of nowhereWell put I am borrowing this one in the futureHere are some ideas anything handwritten or created by hand so original this can range from poetry a cleverly created time line of your relationship with photos in form of a YouTube clip tooI totally relate to what you said thereYes I am with you I find it very hard to fall in love Some people have been known to mistake my friendly extrovert behaviour as some kind of romantic interest Must be going out of style to takeThanks for the reply I agree with what you have said I would actually like to dump and bailout on her at this pointThat is what she said However her friend reporting me to HR would not have any affect on me I do not work there I am simply an individual who applied for a grant which is govt money This moneythank you sane adviceHey I am working with INFP on a community project Without going into too many details a number of people have dropped the ball on her including the Illustrator who was working with her an INTP    So good James is also a Youth WorkerMusician the nonlyrical version of the song is amazing any how  F3  Throwback to 1995Reminds me of the barista at my local Starbucks Still checking if he is going to do some more rad art work and what is next in his life lol  Bono is rumoured to be an ENFJ as well yeah that is the correct way to put I felt my post was rather unbalanced The one male ENFP I know is an excellent photographer  very reliable when it comes to delievering his work I think it wasYes that is what I was conveying Glad it made sense Really tongue  I think about the 2 ENFP friends I have well one is not a friend anymore by virtue of the total lack of effort she puts in our friendship They amass so many friends very quicklyIs it me or do other ENFJs have trouble opening up I find it takes forever for me to actual talk about myself as a person unless someone asks direct questions  but who the heck does that PMostly jealous of their social acumen They walk into a room  trump all the efforts of other people namely ENFJs through their charisma and largerthanlife personalities  I find they say alotI agree with what Gilly said  point on   I find that people simply do not directly ask questions about me I think it is refreshing for ENFJs to be able to talk about themselves We value1 A big party that will have mostly acquaintances and strangers There is alcohol food and music but the point is to mainly talk to others  I would likely be tired thinking about this eventpart in bold  Something tells me that you feel disappointed about this or at least confused that he wanted to stayintouch but chooses not to initiate contact If he is not choosing to contact youThanks for sharing Gilly   Well I believe in my 30s I started to care less about fitting in and pleasing other peoples whims particularly people who wanted me to change I also became muchI did not read the link yet I had a best friend that is a ESTJ Very controlling and unable to accept new ways of doing things It was her way or the highway I also felt she cared too much aboutThanks for the reply I like how you helped me work that out ENFJ brotherHave you tried an I feel statement Basically you would explain how you feel without implicating him So you could say something like I feel  frustrated rejected shut down yes good observation There were other reasons he did not want to share with me I often wonder why he would not want to I typically do not see ESFJs as very private people   Thanks forCouldnt agree more with all that is posted here Dont over complicate things Start with FB  then a coffee before moving on to something more Honestly if she does not want to talk to you sheYes during times of frustration I feel the same Before I reach out to someone I ask myself if they are not there for me when I need them will I be ok with helping them now This help me putQuestion for my ENFJ brothers and sisters  how do you get over a breakup especially with someone you still have great memories with and truly loved I still my ex ESFJ boyfriend and it is beenI would not worry at all He also told you not to worry  trust him The thing is he knows to know she needs to own her feelings and that he is not responsible for them It is important that youWhen I look back on when I met the ESFJ I once dated he was immediately affectionate with me Reached for my hand kissed me  very obvious When we spoke he listened to me intently  asked me some new picture of me By new it is a year old but I have not changed in yearsJust watched the trailer I cannot decide from the itybityclip if he is an ENFJ Looks like an awesome movieMr Selfridge my newest love Fresh Prince of Bel  Air Star Trek the Next Generation thanks to my INFP sister Breaking Bad whole season is fantastic Top Chef  I do not have a lot of time toIts been a while ENFJs    I am curious to know how your views on relationships romantic familial friendships colleagues has changed over the course of your life A broad question that canNot as popular as ENFPs though I find that if their is an ENFP in the room they will outshine us People just gravitate towards them   I think if we need to take care of the needs of the groupIt used to bother me in the past but knowing that I dislike not hate I cannot say I hate anyone some people I am comfortable knowing that others would also dislike me I used to have a sense ofGreat question   I had a little school on the block I would make worksheets buy all kinds of supplies for my stickers  fix the booboos of the little kids Is it surprising that I am aNormally I do not like beards on men However when it comes to Mr Selfridge I would make an exception It looks really sexy Well groomed and suits him well My ex also looked very hot with a beard \n"

      "Actually from these results it looks like you are triplewithdrawn 5w4 9w8 4w5  It would appear that you just happen to have strong 2 6 and 7 traitsIts odd that you are associating the whole

My mom Go do insert known todo task here Me I know My mom Well if you know then why do not you go do it  yeah I am not oneIm gonna guess the EJ types are most likely to groupthink but I am not entirely sure  Thoughts  Also which types are least likely to groupthinkVery true  My guess is that 9s are the most idealized type thanks to our high levels of neutrality and inner tranquility but from the perspective of a 9 it is not worth it to idealize any type I hardly ever wear hats if at all  Nice new avatar BTW dealwithitThe ENTJ I am currently living with apparently has used his Se via cooking amid other things I am not 100 sure of  Hes quite nice with Se compared to TeNi alone  Sometimes I kinda wonder howYou have been criticized of having less thanks than posts guiltyA Type 9 looks at the poll  Were so popular proud  Goes and votes for 9  EDIT and 9th vote  What a number crazyIt seems both of the ISPs seem to hold out relationships and get married longer than the ESPs  Also some stats from Personality Page  Highest Percentage Married   From highest toLooks back at thread  Riiiiiiiiiight so why did I create this thread dry  maybe too much like comparing an ISTP to an INTPMaybe an INTP in a TiSi loop  I tend to be nitpicky about my environment as well due to my high SiSo am I and although my 5w6 is close I am a 9w1 I have absolutely no 8 anywhere in my Enneagram type at allNot to mention it feels somewhat disturbing and unreal to do it all the timePSTypes Enneagram Test Results  The Distribution of Your Scores    Type One  15  Type TwoIm probably the one all the way to the right   Am I now weird for looking well crazyMaybe because Enneagram is not as official and popular as MBTI and so it is hard to find broad realworld statsTP and FP are not necessarily associated with a Pe function  Theyre associated with domaux Ti and Fi respectively  Anyway you could divide up the 16 types in a number of ways of four EJ EPNot an SJ but my mom who is an SJ her parents are most likely ESFJ and ISTPWhy  The discussions fine  nothings heated up in hereI used to wear a watch when I was younger but watches tend to irritate my wrist so I stopped  Besides there are other ways for me to tell time when it is necessary  Also beware under1 Words of Affirmation  Meh  2 Gifts  Giving them yep  Receiving them is another story  3 Acts of Service1 Not entirely sure  Theyre mostly about places than anything else  Seldom if at all are there people in my dreams 2 Often like most other things I remember a dream quite vividly but theTheyll probably get along quite well  This is probably true for any XwY with a YwX  BTW if you were wondering the little w between the numbers stands for wing not with it can be unclearIve wondered how common each of the 9 fundamental Enneagram types are  Does anyone know or have a linkFrom typelogiccom  Intuition is tertiaryas the ESFJ matures and as situations arise which call for suspension of criticism Ne is allowed to play  Under the leadership of the Fe functionFrom typelogiccom  As the ESTJ matures and as situations arise which call for suspension of criticism Extraverted iNtuition is allowed to play  Under the leadership of the Te functionAgain sorry if I am harsh  Try not to take everything here personally  If you look inside the parentheses there is my alternate possibility Im not inconsiderate  It turns out I was justI tend to apologize like that too very reasoned out  Maybe it is a TF thingThis obligation of SJs not just ESTJs amid others is what drives me up a wall sometimes  My ESFJ mother has this tendency to do this to me although not to the degree you are encountering  I find this interesting  I never would have guessed that an ESTJ would tell a white lie this in part due to my stereotypical views of ESTJs  As a thinking type I might get thrown off by this andNot to be harsh but speaking of lies you could be lying about your strong STJ  It looks like you are just strong J either that or I could be misreading the scale  So another question whatHeres a third ISTP to add to that  I will say though that because of my autism I have an unusually strong Si  It could happen to an ISFP and the result could be an autistic ISFP with ISFJHere I replied to your thread happy crazy  Anyway I once read that IFPs such as you do not seem to have much patience with types whose preferences are strongly T or J let alone TJMostly Se and Ni  I rule with Ti so I do not need work there  Te and Fi are doing OK and they will develop better in my later life  Ne I just suck at and Fe I am not too good with either  BothP S  Why do you terms and conditions have to be so long  Do you have any idea how discouraging and redundant that is  Ever heard of plain English and not legaleseI need to get out more recurringthoughtofmineSounds like you need to relax  It also sounds like you need to forgive your INTPs detached perceiving nature  Maybe he got quickly boredThanks to everyone here who shared their twosided Se understanding  I remember my high school ENFJ teacher taking us outside during homeroom  Se relief proudFirst impression ESTJ maybe with a strong Se  Certainly underdeveloped in terms of cognitive functions such as Ne and FiIt looks like you have just won out the rest of us either that or you were not being true to yourselfISTJ Cup of coffee ESTJ Judges mallet for lack of a proper name if there is one ISTP Someone fixing up their cool vehicle be it a car motorcycle bicycle or otherwise ISFP An artistThe question is will it be because we humans could control ourselves or because mother nature forced usI would guess this is an Si thing    Given my strong Si I have become like this as well  However being an SP I do not need routine just need to know how it worksI find it fascinating that some ISFJs have higher Te than Ti  It had me wondering if most other SJs have higher Te and Fe than their Ti and Fi  When my ESFJ mother tested out she had higher TeHow nostalgic are you  It would appear that Si nostalgia is fairly strong among you ESFJs being SiauxI wondered where this thread went  has a thought of music and therefore cannot be describedFrom an ISTP with aux Se this is an insightful thread  I have sometimes wondered if ENFJs or ENxJs for that matter experience Se in a hereandnow manner like SPs doI can imagine like any identity relationship that it will be a nice one but eventually will get boring  I sometimes wonder what an ISFPISTP relationship would look likeLets see  Playing games especially ones that integrate the Ti element which few adventurous games seem to do skiing biking hiking climbing procrastinating here not uncommon among us\n",

search of myself and I used this forum to help discover1 Log in after a week or so of not being on here 2 Look at INFJ forum sees that all the new threads are already ones that I have seen and discussed in the past 3 Check the new posts in case II hope everyone realizes the difference between a nice guy and a well nice guywwwyoutubecomwatchvDOX9l4Ys7NYI would retire my account since I do not ever come on here anymore and I do not really care about MBTI anymore but why put an unnecessary restriction on myselfIm not a virgin In some ways I still wish I wasI lost my virginity to someone who I was not in love with The girl I am with right now is and if it were not for that one girl I would be too andIm 21 I am young amiriteHaving the feeling of being alone  Being able to tell a lot about a person just by their energy Its almost like I have known them for years And then if they find this out it freaks them outhttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvW6NdYKFRyMI think it might be more of a biological thing and how you were raised more than how it is based on your type but I can see how type could play a part  As for meyeah I am nowhere near anI suppose I still am but I have lowered my standards so much to where I date people I do not even like probably just to not feel alone I am a little disgusted with myself at the momenthttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvlRNYp1IiUuEobav2eI know what you mean I have had this same problem for the longest time and I too can seem to spark relationships better over text Weird But anyways I have just forced myself to be a little moreI can imagine most INFJs can relate to this   httpwwwyoutubecomwatchvx4XQfDd0iMcDont trust test results That being said I could very well be an INFJ type 3My views have always been that I will never have sex with someone that I know is just gonna lead to sex and that is it Up to this point I have followed through to that because I cannot imagine givingFor me like most of you it comes out very early on but I try to control my tongue for as long as I can so I hardly ever say it at all at least intentionally At the beginning I think it is lessRight now I am debating whether I am an ENTP or INFJ  Sounds very strange but both of them fit meWho does not get a little genocidal every now and thenWalter may actually be an INFJ not an INTJ The reason I say this is that it is VERY clear to me that Gus is an INTJ but there seems to be some variance between them I will be able to explain moreBout damn timeIm a dude so it is kind of embarrassing that I like this show but it is not too bad The only two I know are Lorelai and Rory and they are ESFP and INFJISFJ respectivelyhttp1bpblogspotcom3hyaG4pNj4QSr61wNAIA2IAAAAAAAAAOAcvTDWWktd3Qs400entpposter2jpg  http1bpblogspotcom3hyaG4pNj4QSr62F7f5nyIAAAAAAAAAPAUMAzC3VMPks400ENTPposter2jpghttpwwwyoutubecomwatchv3YOEO7jtIs4I would say you are an ESFP or ENFP probably leaning stronger with ESFP over ENFP  Youre not introverted At allAre you seriously basing your dating life based on some Personality Theory that may or may not be bullshitI seriously hope this is a joke thread Its getting that bad that I cannot tell if someone is trolling or just flat out fucking stupid  As for who is going to winunless Romeny wins theCongratulationsI never made one in the first place sohey  I am not sure why I am even making this as I am probably just gonna retire this account soon anyway but ya know just thought I would make oneYoure typism  Honestly I do not really have a specific type that annoys me Stupid annoys me not type  That being said for the love of FSM and all that is holy I am NEVER EVER EVERhttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvkynUSL8fr4Since this is not the first time you have posted something like this in the two years I have been here it is in all likelihood depression dude I had the same symptoms for oh 7 years or so and when IIm my own partnerEDIT I guess that is what I get for not reading the whole postCan I come tuck you inYoure probably a 3 then  I am a type three myself and I fall into the more reserved category with most people I would still consider myself extroverted but people who talk nonstop actually gethttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvwc4XsRqXQ7wFairly common I am a 3 but a 3w4 not a 3w2Not at all ENTP I would say ISTP or ESTP if that does not workhttpwwwyoutubecomwatchvrAuCN65LaB0Took the words right out of my mouthJust so everyones clear getting a percentage on a MBTI does not mean you are 75 introvert It means you can be pretty confident you are an introvert  Back on topic I am pretty much certain thatYeah same thing happened to me Fuckers  Dear stupid peoplejust because I do not show it does not mean I am not judging you At least you keep me entertained  Excuse my misogyny but fuckTell me about it But ironically I am dating a girl from California who moved over here a while ago and I met her through Ok Cupid Didnt actually expect that thing to produce results but it hasId say Obama is most definitely an ENFJ Speaking to common values but sticking to his own internal vision etc  Sarah PalinESFJ  Ronald ReaganHard to tell

      "As an ENFJ how ambitious are you I am fairly ambitious I have two undergrad degrees SociologyReligious Studies  in Education in ESLSecondary Education I left about a 3 year gap between bothWelcome  I find that writing my thoughts in freeflow about the situation helps me cope with separating my feelings with the other person I also remind myself that I will not allow anotherhealthy ways  workout regularly yoga talk to my boyfriendfriends Maintain a regular sleep schedule  unhealthy  chocolate more chocolate Sometimes other unhealthy foods It is going excellent Are relationship is building an amazing foundation We love to express our feelings for each other through poetry my preference through drawings  art his preference WeHey INFPs  barely post anymore I just wanted to share that I met my INFP boyfriend on Feb 4th of this year We met through a dating app We have never been more in love  we have both described ourIts been six dates and I found myself an INFP he took the test  and yes he is an INFP The connection is just so amazing and intense right now it even scares me  He told me he has neverI am curious what you would like Yeah we ENFJs are unique Wonder if this has to do with enneagramlove stylesI do not have a ton of info as I have not met this guy in person  only chatted with him yesterday for the first time online Heres what I do know  according to his profile he is looking forHere are some signs  they tend to talk faster  they will have a tougher time filling in gaps in the conversation sometimes they will not initiate the interaction get a bit more shy or wait tillDislike my INFP bestfriends sister We only just met this month I do not know I felt strangely upset about why I do not like her sister and guilty The girl is so selfabsorbed  does things thatYeah I hear you there You just never know that you will fall in love with someone It does come out of nowhereWell put I am borrowing this one in the futureHere are some ideas anything handwritten or created by hand so original this can range from poetry a cleverly created time line of your relationship with photos in form of a YouTube clip tooI totally relate to what you said thereYes I am with you I find it very hard to fall in love Some people have been known to mistake my friendly extrovert behaviour as some kind of romantic interest Must be going out of style to takeThanks for the reply I agree with what you have said I would actually like to dump and bailout on her at this pointThat is what she said However her friend reporting me to HR would not have any affect on me I do not work there I am simply an individual who applied for a grant which is govt money This moneythank you sane adviceHey I am working with INFP on a community project Without going into too many details a number of people have dropped the ball on her including the Illustrator who was working with her an INTPhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvOntHieZofGA    So good James is also a Youth WorkerMusician the nonlyrical version of the song is amazing any howhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgXWD1HjWI8Mampindex35amplistPL940F90747B3D4A  F3  Throwback to 1995Reminds me of the barista at my local Starbucks Still checking if he is going to do some more rad art work and what is next in his life lolhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvZpDQJnI4OhU  Bono is rumoured to be an ENFJ as well yeah that is the correct way to put I felt my post was rather unbalanced The one male ENFP I know is an excellent photographer  very reliable when it comes to delievering his work I think it wasYes that is what I was conveying Glad it made sense Really tongue  I think about the 2 ENFP friends I have well one is not a friend anymore by virtue of the total lack of effort she puts in our friendship They amass so many friends very quicklyIs it me or do other ENFJs have trouble opening up I find it takes forever for me to actual talk about myself as a person unless someone asks direct questions  but who the heck does that PMostly jealous of their social acumen They walk into a room  trump all the efforts of other people namely ENFJs through their charisma and largerthanlife personalities  I find they say alotI agree with what Gilly said  point on   I find that people simply do not directly ask questions about me I think it is refreshing for ENFJs to be able to talk about themselves We value1 A big party that will have mostly acquaintances and strangers There is alcohol food and music but the point is to mainly talk to others  I would likely be tired thinking about this eventpart in bold  Something tells me that you feel disappointed about this or at least confused that he wanted to stayintouch but chooses not to initiate contact If he is not choosing to contact youThanks for sharing Gilly   Well I believe in my 30s I started to care less about fitting in and pleasing other peoples whims particularly people who wanted me to change I also became muchI did not read the link yet I had a best friend that is a ESTJ Very controlling and unable to accept new ways of doing things It was her way or the highway I also felt she cared too much aboutThanks for the reply I like how you helped me work that out ENFJ brotherHave you tried an I feel statement Basically you would explain how you feel without implicating him So you could say something like I feel  frustrated rejected shut downhttpswwwyoutubecomwatchvGKzlvxrEpUNorina yes good observation There were other reasons he did not want to share with me I often wonder why he would not want to I typically do not see ESFJs as very private people   Thanks forCouldnt agree more with all that is posted here Dont over complicate things Start with FB  then a coffee before moving on to something more Honestly if she does not want to talk to you sheYes during times of frustration I feel the same Before I reach out to someone I ask myself if they are not there for me when I need them will I be ok with helping them now This help me putQuestion for my ENFJ brothers and sisters  how do you get over a breakup especially with someone you still have great memories with and truly loved I still my ex ESFJ boyfriend and it is beenI would not worry at all He also told you not to worry  trust him The thing is he knows to know she needs to own her feelings and that he is not responsible for them It is important that youWhen I look back on when I met the ESFJ I once dated he was immediately affectionate with me Reached for my hand kissed me  very obvious When we spoke he listened to me intently  asked me some new picture of me By new it is a year old but I have not changed in yearsJust watched the trailer I cannot decide from the itybityclip if he is an ENFJ Looks like an awesome movieMr Selfridge my newest love Fresh Prince of Bel  Air Star Trek the Next Generation thanks to my INFP sister Breaking Bad whole season is fantastic Top Chef  I do not have a lot of time toIts been a while ENFJs    I am curious to know how your views on relationships romantic familial friendships colleagues has changed over the course of your life A broad question that canNot as popular as ENFPs though I find that if their is an ENFP in the room they will outshine us People just gravitate towards them   I think if we need to take care of the needs of the groupIt used to bother me in the past but knowing that I dislike not hate I cannot say I hate anyone some people I am comfortable knowing that others would also dislike me I used to have a sense ofGreat question   I had a little school on the block I would make worksheets buy all kinds of supplies for my stickers  fix the booboos of the little kids Is it surprising that I am aNormally I do not like beards on men However when it comes to Mr Selfridge I would make an exception It looks really sexy Well groomed and suits him well My ex also looked very hot with a beard \n"

There is a trend when window size increase from 5 to 7, the total accuracy always decreases. Also, in term of syntatic accuracy, when dimension increases, it will increases accordingly. The reason for them is likely to be the high dimension can represent more feature of words so when dimension is under 200, some of the features are not represented completely and then the total performance will not so good."

    "Here is result of the classification model under different preprocessing techniques. The best model comes from the corpus removing urls and stopwords and stemming. The corpus without url is better than with url, I think that makes sense because url will have some irrelated words, so it may bring interferences when training our classification model. Also, some stopwords can be the interferences to our model as well. The core of a sentence should be verbs and nouns which are what the model should most concern with. So after removing that, the accuracy of the model get a very apparent increasement."
